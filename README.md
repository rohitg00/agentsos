```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iii-hq/agentos/main/scripts/install.sh | sh
agentos start
```

Two commands. Zero config. Boots the engine, 51 workers, and a 25-screen TUI dashboard.

## What Makes This Different

Most agent frameworks give you chains, graphs, and prompt templates. AgentOS gives you three primitives:

| Primitive | What It Does |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Worker** | A process that connects to the engine and registers functions |
| **Function** | A callable unit of work — agents, tools, security, memory, everything |
| **Trigger** | Binds a function to HTTP, cron, queue, or pub/sub |

That's it. Every capability — from LLM routing to swarm coordination to self-evolving functions — is a plain function on the [iii-engine](https://iii.dev) bus. No frameworks, no vendor lock-in, no magic.

**What you get out of the box:**
- **Self-evolving functions** — agents write, test, and improve their own code at runtime
- **Self-curating memory** — agents reflect on conversations and extract durable facts automatically
- **Multi-agent orchestration** — plan features, decompose tasks, spawn workers, monitor progress
- **Session recovery** — health scanning detects stale/dead agents and auto-recovers them
- **18 security layers** — RBAC, WASM sandbox, Merkle audit, encrypted vault, timing-safe HMAC
- **25 LLM providers** — swap between Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, Ollama, or 20 others. One config change.
- **40 channel adapters** — Slack, Discord, WhatsApp, Telegram, and 36 more

</p>

## Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iii-hq/agentos/main/scripts/install.sh | sh
```

Installs both **iii-engine** and **agentos** binary to `~/.local/bin`.

```bash
AGENTOS_VERSION=v0.1.0 curl -fsSL ... | sh   # specific version
BIN_DIR=/usr/local/bin curl -fsSL ... | sh    # custom install dir
```

## Quickstart

```bash
# Install and start (zero config — auto-detects ANTHROPIC_API_KEY from env)
agentos start

# Chat with an agent
agentos chat

# Open the 25-screen terminal dashboard
agentos tui
```

`agentos start` handles everything: creates `~/.agentos/` on first run, downloads iii-engine if missing, generates config, boots the engine and all 51 workers. Ctrl+C to stop.

### Set an API key (if not in environment)

```bash
agentos config set-key anthropic sk-ant-...
```

### Development mode

```bash
# Start with hot reload
agentos init --quick
npm run dev

# Run tests
npm test                    # 1,748 TypeScript tests
cargo test --workspace      # Rust crate tests
```

## Architecture

**Polyglot by design** — Rust for hot path, TypeScript for iteration speed, Python for ML.

Every component connects to the iii-engine over WebSocket and registers functions. Functions call other functions via `trigger()`. That's it.

## Control Plane

The control plane layer provides full agent orchestration — multi-tenant isolation, org hierarchies, goal alignment, task management, budget enforcement, governance, scheduling, and external runtime adapters.

All 8 crates are Rust workers on iii-sdk, exposing 45 functions via 44 HTTP endpoints and 2 PubSub triggers.

```rust
trigger("realm::create", json!({ "name": "production", "description": "Prod environment" }))
trigger("hierarchy::set", json!({ "realmId": "r-1", "agentId": "agent-ceo", "title": "CEO" }))
trigger("directive::create", json!({ "realmId": "r-1", "title": "Ship v2", "level": "realm" }))
trigger("mission::create", json!({ "realmId": "r-1", "title": "Build auth", "directiveId": "dir-1" }))

## Swarms

Multi-agent swarm coordination for complex tasks:

```typescript
trigger("swarm::create", {
  goal: "Research and write a technical blog post",
  agents: ["researcher", "writer", "editor"],
  strategy: "sequential"
})
```

Strategies: `parallel`, `sequential`, `consensus`, `hierarchical`.

## Knowledge Graph

Entity-relation graph for structured knowledge:

```typescript
trigger("kg::add_entity", { type: "project", name: "agentos", properties: { ... } })
trigger("kg::add_relation", { from: "agentos", to: "iii-engine", type: "built_on" })
trigger("kg::query", { entity: "agentos", depth: 2 })
```

## Artifact DAG

Git-style DAG-based content exchange for swarms. Agents push versioned artifacts with parent references, enabling branching histories, diffs, and frontier discovery.

```typescript
const node = await trigger("artifact::push", {
  content: { report: "Q1 analysis..." },
  parentIds: ["art_abc123"],
  agentId: "analyst-1",
  swarmId: "swarm_research",
  metadata: { type: "report", format: "markdown" }
})

const leaves = await trigger("artifact::leaves", { swarmId: "swarm_research" })

const diff = await trigger("artifact::diff", { nodeIdA: "art_abc123", nodeIdB: node.nodeId })
```

**6 functions**: `artifact::push`, `artifact::fetch`, `artifact::children`, `artifact::leaves`, `artifact::diff`, `artifact::history`

- Content-addressed with SHA-256 hashing (first 16 hex chars)
- Parent validation on push (all parentIds must exist)
- Swarm-scoped publishing via PubSub (`artifact:{swarmId}` topic)
- Frontier discovery (leaves with no children, excluding orphans)
- 512KB max content size per artifact

## Coordination Board

Persistent inter-agent communication channels with threaded posts and pinning.

```typescript
await trigger("coord::create_channel", {
  name: "design-decisions",
  description: "Architecture discussions",
  agentId: "architect-1"
})

await trigger("coord::post", {
  channelId: "chan_abc123",
  agentId: "architect-1",
  content: "Proposal: switch to event sourcing for audit trail"
})

await trigger("coord::reply", {
  channelId: "chan_abc123",
  parentId: "post_xyz789",
  agentId: "reviewer-1",
  content: "Agreed — aligns with our immutability requirements"
})

await trigger("coord::pin", { channelId: "chan_abc123", postId: "post_xyz789" })
```

**6 functions**: `coord::create_channel`, `coord::post`, `coord::reply`, `coord::list_channels`, `coord::read`, `coord::pin`

- Threaded replies via `parentId`
- Pin/unpin with 25-pin limit per channel
- 1,000-post limit per channel
- Auth enforced on post and reply (HTTP requests)
- PubSub notifications on `coord:{channelId}` topic

## Agent Intelligence

Self-improving agent capabilities that run automatically during normal operation.

### Memory Reflection

Agents periodically curate their own memory. Every 5 turns, a background reflection extracts durable facts from the conversation and stores them as `[Curated]` entries for future recall.

```typescript
trigger("reflect::check_turn", { agentId: "agent-1", sessionId: "s1", iterations: 3 })
trigger("reflect::curate_memory", { agentId: "agent-1", sessionId: "s1" })
trigger("reflect::discover_skills", { agentId: "agent-1", sessionId: "s1", iterations: 8 })
```

- **3 functions**: `reflect::check_turn`, `reflect::curate_memory`, `reflect::discover_skills`
- Auto-extracts preferences, decisions, learnings from conversation
- Auto-discovers reusable skills from tool-heavy sessions (5+ iterations) via `evolve::generate`
- Builds user profile automatically (`memory::user_profile::update`)
- Fire-and-forget — never blocks the chat response

### Structured Context Compression

5-phase compression that preserves context quality:

1. **Prune** — truncate old tool results (>200 chars)
2. **Sanitize** — fix orphaned tool call/result pairs
3. **Merge** — combine consecutive system messages
4. **Protect** — reserve 40% of token budget for recent context
5. **Summarize** — LLM generates structured summary (Goal / Progress / Decisions / Files / Next Steps / Critical Context)

Iterative: detects existing summaries and updates them instead of re-summarizing from scratch.

### User Profile Modeling

Agents build a persistent understanding of who they're working with:

```typescript
trigger("memory::user_profile::update", { agentId: "agent-1", updates: { workStyle: "concise" } })
trigger("memory::user_profile::get", { agentId: "agent-1" })
trigger("memory::session_search", { agentId: "agent-1", query: "deployment pipeline" })
```

- Profile auto-injected as `[User Profile]` system message in every chat
- Cross-session search with keyword + recency scoring
- Deep-merge updates (objects merged, arrays concatenated)

### Smart Model Routing

Complexity-aware model selection with per-agent tier support:

```typescript
trigger("llm::route", { message: "Step 1: create DB. Then build API.", toolCount: 5, agentTier: "premium" })
```

- Detects multi-step instructions, multiple code blocks, reasoning keywords
- `economy` tier: always routes to fastest model
- `premium` tier: never below mid-tier
- Default: automatic complexity scoring

## Orchestration

Multi-agent coordination and lifecycle management.

### Session Lifecycle

Formal state machine for agent sessions with declarative reaction rules:

```text
spawning → working → blocked → working (retry)
working → pr_open → review → merged → done
working → failed → recovering → working
```

```typescript
trigger("lifecycle::transition", { agentId: "agent-1", newState: "working" })
trigger("lifecycle::add_reaction", {
  from: "working", to: "blocked",
  action: "send_to_agent",
  payload: { message: "You appear stuck. What's blocking you?" },
  escalateAfter: 3,
})
```

- **5 functions**: `lifecycle::transition`, `lifecycle::get_state`, `lifecycle::add_reaction`, `lifecycle::list_reactions`, `lifecycle::check_all`
- Validates transitions, fires hooks on state changes
- 4 reaction types: `send_to_agent`, `notify`, `escalate`, `auto_recover`
- Auto-scans all agents every 2 minutes via cron

### Task Decomposition

Recursive task breakdown with hierarchical IDs and status propagation:

```typescript
const { rootId, tasks } = await trigger("task::decompose", {
  description: "Build a user authentication system with OAuth and rate limiting"
})

await trigger("task::spawn_workers", { rootId })
```

- **5 functions**: `task::decompose`, `task::get`, `task::update_status`, `task::list`, `task::spawn_workers`
- Hierarchical IDs: `1` → `1.1` → `1.1.2`
- Status propagation: all siblings complete → parent complete, child fails → parent blocked
- Each leaf task gets its own agent via `tool::agent_spawn`

### Session Recovery

Automated health scanning and recovery for agent sessions:

```typescript
trigger("recovery::scan", {})
trigger("recovery::recover", { agentId: "agent-1" })
```

- **5 functions**: `recovery::scan`, `recovery::validate`, `recovery::classify`, `recovery::recover`, `recovery::report`
- Classification: `healthy`, `degraded`, `dead`, `unrecoverable`
- Degraded → wake-up message, Dead → circuit breaker reset + restart, Unrecoverable → escalate to human
- Auto-scans every 10 minutes via cron

### Orchestrator

Meta-agent that plans and coordinates multi-agent work:

```typescript
const { planId, analysis } = await trigger("orchestrator::plan", {
  description: "Build a real-time analytics dashboard",
  autoExecute: true,
})

await trigger("orchestrator::status", { planId })
await trigger("orchestrator::intervene", { planId, action: "pause" })
```

- **4 functions**: `orchestrator::plan`, `orchestrator::execute`, `orchestrator::status`, `orchestrator::intervene`
- LLM analyzes feature complexity, estimates agents needed, generates decomposition prompt
- Decomposes tasks, registers lifecycle reactions, spawns workers
- Human intervention: pause, resume, cancel, redirect

### Signal Injection

Push external signals (CI failures, review comments) directly into agent sessions:

```typescript
trigger("feedback::inject_signal", {
  agentId: "agent-1",
  signalType: "ci_failure",
  content: "Build failed: TypeError in auth.ts line 42",
  metadata: { source: "github-actions" },
})
```

- **3 functions**: `feedback::inject_signal`, `feedback::register_source`, `feedback::list_signals`
- Signal types: `ci_failure`, `review_comment`, `merge_conflict`, `dependency_update`, `custom`
- Auto-routes to agent via `tool::agent_send`

## Dynamic Function Evolution

Agents can write, register, evaluate, and improve functions at runtime. The evolve-eval-feedback loop turns AgentOS from a static orchestrator into a self-evolving system.

```text
Agent goal/spec
    ↓
evolve::generate  →  LLM writes function code
    ↓
evolve::register  →  security scan → vm sandbox → register on iii bus
    ↓
eval::suite       →  invoke N times → score each → aggregate
    ↓
feedback::review  →  analyze scores → KEEP / IMPROVE / KILL
    ↓                    ↓              ↓
    ↓               evolve::generate   evolve::unregister
    ↓               (with feedback)
    ↓
feedback::promote →  draft → staging → production
```

### Evolve (8 functions, 8 endpoints)

```typescript
trigger("evolve::generate", { goal: "Double a number", name: "doubler", agentId: "agent-1" })
trigger("evolve::register", { functionId: "evolved::doubler_v1" })
trigger("evolve::list", { status: "production" })

trigger("evolve::fork", { functionId: "evolved::doubler_v1", goal: "Handle negative numbers", agentId: "agent-2" })
trigger("evolve::leaves", { name: "doubler" })
trigger("evolve::lineage", { functionId: "evolved::doubler_v3" })
```

- LLM generates function code from a goal/spec
- Code runs in a `node:vm` sandbox (no fetch, fs, process, require, setTimeout, eval)
- Sandboxed `trigger()` proxy only allows `evolved::`, `tool::`, `llm::` prefixes
- Pre-registration security scan via `skill::pipeline`
- Lifecycle: `draft` → `staging` → `production` → `deprecated` → `killed`
- **DAG branching**: fork from any version (not just latest), discover frontier leaves, trace full lineage to root

### Eval (6 functions, 5 endpoints)

```typescript
trigger("eval::run", { functionId: "evolved::doubler_v1", input: { value: 5 }, expected: { doubled: 10 } })
trigger("eval::suite", { suiteId: "suite_doubler" })
trigger("eval::compare", { functionIdA: "evolved::doubler_v1", functionIdB: "evolved::doubler_v2", testCases: [...] })
```

- Pluggable scorers: `exact_match`, `llm_judge`, `semantic_similarity`, `custom`
- Inline auto-scoring on every evolved function call (configurable: auto/sampled/manual/off)
- Score formula: correctness (50%) + safety (25%) + latency (15%) + cost (10%)

### Feedback (7 functions, 6 endpoints + cron)

```typescript
trigger("feedback::review", { functionId: "evolved::doubler_v1" })
trigger("feedback::promote", { functionId: "evolved::doubler_v1", targetStatus: "production" })
trigger("feedback::leaderboard", {})
```

- Auto-review every 6 hours via cron
- Decision algorithm: kill (≥3 failures in last 5), improve (avg < 0.5), keep
- Recursive improvement: up to 3 attempts with LLM feedback
- Leaderboard ranking by overall score

## Session Replay

Record and replay full agent sessions for debugging:

```typescript
trigger("replay::record", { sessionId, agentId, action: "tool_call", data: { toolId, args } })
trigger("replay::get", { sessionId })
trigger("replay::summary", { sessionId })
```

- **Taint Tracking**: Information flow control (Secret, PII, UntrustedAgent labels)
- **Manifest Signing**: Ed25519 signatures for agent/skill manifests
- **Tool Policy**: Configurable allow/deny/approve policies per tool
- **Approval Tiers**: Auto (read-only), Async (write), Sync (destructive) with exponential backoff
- **Docker Sandbox**: Container-isolated code execution
- **WASM Sandbox**: wasmtime-based untrusted code execution with fuel limits
- **Prompt Injection**: Regex-based injection pattern scanning
- **Rate Limiting**: GCRA token bucket per agent
- **Loop Guard**: Infinite loop detection with circuit breaker

## Testing

Test suites:

```bash
npx vitest --run                              # TypeScript unit/integration
npm run test:e2e                              # Black-box API e2e (requires AGENTOS_API_KEY)
cargo test --workspace                        # Rust crates
python3 -m pytest                             # Python worker tests
```

## How It Works

Every component is a **Worker** that registers **Functions** and binds them to **Triggers**:

```rust
// Rust worker
let iii = register_worker("ws://localhost:49134", InitOptions::default());

iii.register_function_with_description(
    "agent::chat",
    "Process a message through the agent loop",
    move |input: Value| { /* ... */ },
);

iii.register_trigger("queue", "agent::chat", json!({ "topic": "agent.inbox" }))?;
```

```typescript
// TypeScript worker (direct iii-sdk registerWorker API)
import { registerWorker } from "iii-sdk";
import { ENGINE_URL, OTEL_CONFIG, registerShutdown } from "./shared/config.js";

const sdk = registerWorker(ENGINE_URL, { workerName: "api", otel: OTEL_CONFIG });
registerShutdown(sdk);
const { registerFunction, registerTrigger, trigger } = sdk;

registerFunction(
  {
    id: 'api::chat_completions',
    description: 'OpenAI-compatible chat completions',
    metadata: { category: 'api' },
    request_format: [
      { name: 'model', type: 'string', required: true },
      { name: 'messages', type: 'array', required: true },
    ],
  },
  async (req) => { /* ... */ }
)

registerTrigger({
  type: 'http',
  function_id: 'api::chat_completions',
  config: { api_path: 'v1/chat/completions', http_method: 'POST' }
})
```

```python
# Python worker
iii = III("ws://localhost:49134", worker_name="embedding")

@iii.function(id="embedding::generate", description="Generate text embeddings")
async def generate_embedding(input):
    # ...
```

Functions call each other via `trigger()` regardless of language:

```
HTTP POST /v1/chat/completions
  → api::chat_completions (TypeScript)
    → agent::chat (Rust)
      → security::check_capability (Rust)
      → approval::classify (TypeScript)
      → memory::recall (Rust)
      → llm::route (Rust)
      → llm::complete (TypeScript)
      → tool::web_search (TypeScript)
      → loop_guard::check (TypeScript)
    → memory::store (Rust)
    → replay::record (TypeScript)
```

## Requirements

- [iii-engine](https://iii.dev) current stable (iii-sdk registerWorker API with built-in OTel, cron triggers, metadata schemas)
- Rust 1.75+
- Node.js 20+
- Python 3.11+ (optional, for embeddings)
